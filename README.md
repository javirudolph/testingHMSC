# testingHMSC

This repository contains the code associated to the manuscript "The Internal Structure of Metacommunities". It has all the scripts associated to the simulations and analysis, but not RDS or data files. All data files should be able to be recreated by the user with the provided scripts. 

If cloning this repository, to get our simulated data, open the repository's project in RStudio, and then run the script `run_all_manuscript.R`, which should save all the outputs in a folder created by the script.
