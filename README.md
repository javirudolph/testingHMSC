# testingHMSC

This repository contains the code associated to the manuscript "The Internal Structure of Metacommunities". It has all the scripts associated to the simulations and analysis, but not RDS or data files. All data files should be able to be recreated by the user with the provided scripts. 

If cloning this repository, to get our simulated data, open the repository's project in RStudio, and then run the script `run_all_manuscript.R`, which should save all the outputs in a folder created by the script. 

## [manuscript_functions:](https://github.com/javirudolph/testingHMSC/tree/master/manuscript_functions)


    
* [**aboutScripts-FAQ**](https://github.com/javirudolph/testingHMSC/tree/master/aboutScripts-FAQ) - this folder has some questions/answers regarding the code, the functions and some of the provided data. Examples such as a quick view of the landscape for simulations, visualization tests and a description of functions used for simulations are provided.  
   * The landscape used for all of our simulations is visualized [here](https://github.com/javirudolph/testingHMSC/blob/master/aboutScripts-FAQ/whatsOurLandscapeLike.md)  
   * A description of the functions and model used to simulate our metacommunity data is found [over here](https://github.com/javirudolph/testingHMSC/blob/master/aboutScripts-FAQ/metacom_sims_functions.md). This basically helps visualize the appendix section of the manuscript.  
   * A failed attempt to move away from ternary plots is shown [here](https://github.com/javirudolph/testingHMSC/blob/master/aboutScripts-FAQ/ideasVisualizeVP.md)  
   * To visualize the response to the environment we compared a gaussian and quadratic term used in the `S_f` function of the  metacommunity model we made [figures](https://github.com/javirudolph/testingHMSC/blob/master/aboutScripts-FAQ/environmentOnSpeciesOccupancy.md)
