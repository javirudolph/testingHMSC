```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
```

In all of the simulations done previously, two .txt files were associated to them. These corresponded to the environmental variable and the xy coordinate of pathces. 

I don't know how these were obtained or how they are arranged in space

Here it is how they look visually for the 1000 patches considered:

```{r}
N <- 1000
XY <- read.table("XY.txt")[1:N,]
E <- read.table("E.txt")[1:N,]

plotData <- cbind.data.frame(XY, E)
names(plotData) <- c("X", "Y", "E")


ggplot(plotData, aes(x = X, y = Y, color = E)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()
```

The sites, or plots, are randomly distributed and so is the value of the environmental variable. 


```{r}
ggplot(plotData) +
  geom_density(aes(x = E)) +
  theme_classic()
```
