We tried changing the niche breadth (increase) to allow for interactions to play a role in the Figure2c scenario. It didn't work so now we are trying to test a range of niche breadths to see at which point we are able to see interactions. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file())
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
library(ggtern)
```
