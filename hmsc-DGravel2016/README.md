# testingHMSC - original scripts

I ran all the original scripts provided in the dropbox. There is an associated Rmd file that renders to an html document which can be viewed in a web browser. The Rmd file calls for outputs and figures, so all scripts have to run before this. 
The html file is also available in the dropbox folder, under the 2019 updates with the name `origScripts`
